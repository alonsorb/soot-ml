# Characterization of Soot Properties in Coflow Laminar Axisymmetric Difussion Flames Using Image Processing and Machine Learning

#### This repository contains a minimum working example for the training and evaluation of an ML model based on U-Net to characterize the soot volume fraction field $f_s$ and the soot temperature field $T_s$.

:warning: Copy the training and test sets into each `npy-\*` directory before running the notebooks. The `*.npy` datasets are available upon request.

#### Requirements

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- Sklearn
